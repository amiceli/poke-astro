# Pokastro

## Idea

This project is a side project to test Astro. I want to try to use multiple
frameworks in the same project.

Currently pokastro use Vue, Svelte, Typescript, HalfmoonJS and lit-element.

## Pages

Currently pokastro has two pages : 

- pokequiz : a simple game to guess pokemon name
- pokelight : a simple page to search pokemon by name

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                        |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `npm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
| `npm run preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying |
